# json

`"key":"value"` where key is a string

`{}` curly brackets indicate an *object*
=> becomes a `dict` in python

`[]` square brackets indicate an *array* of values 
=> becomes a list or tuple in python
==> can become the value of a key

`null` in json is made `None` in python

Visual Studio Code has a *beautify* option in command palette for readability.


# Database

Denormalized => combining several tables into one (for easier consumption by users)

Normalized would be the data in it's seperate tables
