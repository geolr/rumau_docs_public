# git (just local)

`git add file.txt` is *staging* the changes on a file for later commit.

`git commit -m "why this change was done"` commiting the changes together with an explanation

# Send to remote

to push local commits to remote:
?`git push origin main`

`git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME>`

# Get from remote

`git pull origin main` is a combination of `fetch` and `merge` (get the changes from remote and combine with own changes)
